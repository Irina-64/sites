Release.  
Let go of things that don't serve you.  
Thank them or threw them out but get rid of them.  
But everything you hold is something you must carry.  
To move swiftly, carry less.

## The journal entry

> With pride, we keep every failure in.
> And with pride, hold onto the sinking.
> — Clarity, Jimmy Eat World

My musical education took place washing dishes at a coffee shop. On occasion, I'd close with young indie dream — who's name I've since forgotten.

She was 18 or so and I remember getting lost in watching her quietly and cooly tolerate the world. Her one delight was locking the door, putting on her favorite CD, and enjoying it with whoever happened to be around. That part was played by me. I crushed on her in that impossible way that one might crush on a best-friend's older sibling.

Amid the glut of indie albums that inform my taste to this day, was Clarity by Jimmy Eat World. I have never and will never again hear an album that transcendent.

> And with pride, we hold every failure in

I went to bed on new year's eve with this lyric rattling the cages of my brain. I want 2021 to be about clarity, focus, and freedom from clutter of years past. And this song from the start of my adult journey came rushing back to me.

Progress hides behind failure.  
It's birthed from failure.  
We can't separate one from the other.  
Jekyll always comes with Hyde — our efforts separate only amplify their presentation.

> And with pride, we hold onto the sinking

The older I become, the more I retain.  
More weight, more insurance, more cables, receipts, proofs of purchase, personal details to help me navigate the people I can't stand at work...

I was free when I heard this song.  
The thought hadn't occurred to me — 20 years later — I'd be drown by the things and information I'd picked up along the way.

If I can't take it with me? What's even worth keeping around? What can I safely get rid? What truths have I internalized enough to rid myself of the artifact?

I know that it's time to let go of the sinking.
