## 2 The Fine Art of Correction — Why We Overestimate Setup

### Summary

> Preparation. Then presence.

I've felt this most in my evolution as a conversationalist — I can't say "podcaster".

My best conversations are when I prepare in advance.
But, in the moment, be perfectly present — not thinking about directing or framing — just being there.

### Thoughts with friends

- ma says that he thinks i'm good at this — actually changing my mind readily when better information is presented
  - he suggestions the notion that small changes can be harder than big changes — changing a destination vs correcting the path
- em mentions something she heard in a message "long obedience in the same direction"
  - there is no _moment of arrival_
- dustin admits the need to adjust feeling like a failure
  - identifies with the books line about "doing away with the stigma around constant correction"
- dan identifies with a tendency to overvalue upfront costs
  - uses a term a like "when your plans meet other people", in describing when and why plans often need correction
- i share about my excitement over learning this balance of "preparation and presence"
  - used epicreact.dev/podcast as as example of a success on this front — careful upfront planning followed by presence in every episode, willingness to review and correct, and adapt
- emily identifies the need for "emotional preparation to adapt"
- ma connects "rabbit holes", in the language of Shape Up
  - identifying things that will _probably_ go wrong or take to long
- i share mine and nellie's "worked/didn't" framework
- dan inquiries about when the reversal of this principle. posits that "first impressions" are something that are difficult to course carrect
- i share that i visualize first impressions creating a moat around a castle. good first ones make that relationship easy to revisit. bad ones can require require heroing effort to overcome
- dan "and sometimes you storm that castle to find nothing in the treasury"

## 3 The Pledge

### Thoughts with friends

- ma says he has nothing that is non-negotiable. "I have nothing hard in my life"
- allie is not in a position to be inflexible. grieves the loss of the stage of life where this was a luxury
- dan feels this is in opposition of with the previous lesson rule on being flexible.
- allie references shauna inquest "things i will never do" — present over perfect
- i mention the most important section of my todo list being the "things i'm not doin today" section at the top. it's a sacrifice on the alter of the things i want to do that day
- dan ... decision fatigue. and how absolute commitment provides value there
  - me: trap is the setup overestimation issue
    - dave rams budget
- rigidity metaphor pipes, wires, and conduit
- dan: achievement thru repeatedly doing the same thing
  - warren buffet
- allie: falsy equiates rigidity with being brittle. can still have elasticity
- ma: is it necessary to have things that you just absolutely won't budge on
- chan: " will dump your ass" — establishes boundaries to live smoothly and making breaking that decision intentional
- ma: all things are in brain at all times. doesn't live with a feeling of the inflexibility of any of these things
- me "decision" is a tactic for survival. i make functional (and knowingly wrong) decisions on things until they're more important
- em — projecting doom, planning to avoid. wants rules to hold line (safety). constantly deciding "rigid" until not
- dan, it might be easier when applying these things to trivial things
- em coffee is a functional non-negotiable
- de-ciding "beef" tri-tip vs
- freelancing and camping
  - rigidity that grands flexibility
- pre-deciding
