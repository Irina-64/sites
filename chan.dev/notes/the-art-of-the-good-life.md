## 2 The Fine Art of Correction

Why We Overestimate Setup

### Summary

> Preparation. Then presence.

I've felt this most in my evolution as a conversationalist — I can't say "podcaster".

My best conversations are when I prepare in advance.
But, in the moment, be perfectly present — not thinking about directing or framing — just being there.

### Thoughts with friends

- ma says that he thinks i'm good at this — actually changing my mind readily when better information is presented
  - he suggestions the notion that small changes can be harder than big changes — changing a destination vs correcting the path
- em mentions something she heard in a message "long obedience in the same direction"
  - there is no _moment of arrival_
- dustin admits the need to adjust feeling like a failure
  - identifies with the books line about "doing away with the stigma around constant correction"
- dan identifies with a tendency to overvalue upfront costs
  - uses a term a like "when your plans meet other people", in describing when and why plans often need correction
- i share about my excitement over learning this balance of "preparation and presence"
  - used epicreact.dev/podcast as as example of a success on this front — careful upfront planning followed by presence in every episode, willingness to review and correct, and adapt
- emily identifies the need for "emotional preparation to adapt"
- ma connects "rabbit holes", in the language of Shape Up
  - identifying things that will _probably_ go wrong or take to long
- i share mine and nellie's "worked/didn't" framework
- dan inquiries about when the reversal of this principle. posits that "first impressions" are something that are difficult to course carrect
- i share that i visualize first impressions creating a moat around a castle. good first ones make that relationship easy to revisit. bad ones can require require heroing effort to overcome
- dan "and sometimes you storm that castle to find nothing in the treasury"

## 3 The Pledge

Inflexibility as a Strategem

### Summary

> "Precided" — decided, until proven undecided
> Decision over choice

If you want to orient toward efficacy, you have to make decisions before you've seen all the choices.  
If we don't the choices — once we realize them — will make us useless.

### Thoughts with friends

- ma says he has nothing that is non-negotiable. "I have nothing hard in my life" [snicker]
- allie is not in a position to be inflexible. grieves the loss of the stage of life where this was a luxury
- dan feels this is in opposition of with the previous lesson rule on being flexible
- allie references "things i will never do" concept by Shauna Niequist — <mark>"present over perfect"</mark>
  - [Bittersweet: Thoughts on Change, Grace, and Learning the Hard Way](https://amzn.to/3fdl81V)
- i mention the most important section of my todo list being the <mark>"things i'm not doin today"</mark> section at the top. it's a sacrifice on the alter of the things i want to do that day
  - [DO IT NOW / FUCK IT NOTEPAD](https://www.terrapinstationers.com/products/do-it-now-fuck-it-note-pads)
- dan mentions how absolute commitment is a good defense against decision fatigue
  - [Ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion)
  - me: trap is the setup overestimation issue
    - dave rams budget as an example of a _pledge_ that has to be _regularly corrected_
- i share my stupid metaphore about pipes, wires, and conduit
  - conduit is rigid pipes to guide flexible wire. <mark>pledges are the framework that guard and direct unstructured work. they are the pillars. when you re-think them, it means the structures they protect will also be brought into question.</mark>
- dan: "achievement thru repeatedly doing the same thing"
  - warren buffet
- allie says we falsy equiate rigidity with being brittle. <mark>rigid things can still elasticity</mark>
  - roller coasters and airplane wings
- ma asks if it's necessary to have things that you just absolutely won't budge on
- i mention that, beyond our wedding vows, nellie and i have a much more casual agreement "cheat on me and I will dump your ass"
  - if cheating were to ever happen, my i could forgive here but the boundary is clearly stated from "go"
  - <mark>established houndaries make breaking them an intentional decision</mark>
- ma says "I have all things are in brain at all times". he doesn't live with a feeling of the inflexibility of any of these things
  - i say "decision" is a tactic for survival. i make functional (and knowingly wrong) decisions on things until they're more important
- em says she is someone who is projecting doom and planning to avoid. wants rules to "hold the line" (safety). constantly deciding "rigid" until not
- dan suggests that it might be easier when applying these things to trivial things
- em says "coffee is a functional non-negotiable"
- i go off for a bit about the etymology of <mark>["decision", which means "to cut off"](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=decision)</mark> and something stupid about "tri-tips being a weird cut of beef that dissallow other cuts from being made"
- concept [lost attribution] <mark>freelancing and camping</mark>
  - rigidity that grands flexibility
  - [Theory of limiting constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints)
- i suggest <mark>"preciding"</mark> as the functional value of "pledges"
  - <mark>"decided until proven undecided"</mark>

## 4 Block Box Thinking — Reality Doesn't Care About Your Feelings; or, Why Every False Step Improves Your Life

the success after a failing. researchers mind. what is the virtuous change we can make

"in aviation, everything we know is because someone died"

radical exceptance
black box thinking

shifting unhappinesa focus

"obscanterantous"

berton russel: nothing is more fatiguing and more exasperating than the daily effort tk believe thjngs that daily become more incredible...

"consider calmly the hypothesis that they are bad plays"

seeing others more clearly than we do ourselves.
i've had a strategy at times to say to trusted advisors "i will do exactly what you tell me to do"

if you can't where you've got a foot wrong, you will fall flat on your face again.

"don't wait foe the consequences to unfold. if you don't deal with reality, it will deal with you"

problems don't improve with age

- em: annoyed that he said we're don't see our flaws clearly. feels just as critical of self as of others
  - ally: feels the author has a "tone of authority as if everyone is the same"
- me: i interpreted it as "it's easier to see when someone else is in the weeds than when we are in the weeds"
- dma: it's so much easier to deconstruct when they went wrong
- we put "us" and "them" on opposite ends of a spectrum "it's easy to see where things went wrong ------ it's complicated"
  - allie feels like she feels like the opposite. she feels she sees where she went wrong, not 'it's complicated'"
- dma as a tool for objectively noting your own life
- emily: guided practice of "document what happened" not "how it felt"
  - easy to identify self as source of personal anxiety
  - ma: therapist "you're telling the story wrong.
- me: obscurantism. refocusing
  - me: observing your own thoughts "i was the person who inserted the connective tissue between these two objectively unrelated things"
- allie: this connects to the first chapter. "lying to yourself with or without intention"?
- dma: back-solving. does this really well at work but not in personal life
- chan: effective historian at planning center. wait, that's always been a liability. shit. maybe i should stop and just to that publicly instead. at least focus it to _only_ things that can be generalized
  - emily feels baad this for work. has to reconstruct history every time
- chan: "in aviation, everything we know is because someone died". feels true but an extreme version of truth
  - dma is particular in its ability to have enough data
  - me: measure first
    - american hubris likes to "intentionally throw out the black box"
      - the practical effects of that is that, when we have problems, we don't have the tools or capacity to have "productive thought" (ref to allie)
    - ma: airline vs uber/lyft (prop 22). airlines feel this effect immediately.
    - me: airlines front-loaded the pain and then developed a practice that informed every day after that. quick pain; quick progress. vs hubris first, solutions later.
    - ma: it's easier to write fixes and never sit with the pain

## "strategic vacationing"

- Dan: has already internalized this as "what's the full cost of this thing?"
  - but do i just want to drive a car
  - "oops. i forgot onions. i'll just jump back in the car and get those"
- me: the creation of emergencies thru lack of planning and presence. "streaming" a grocery list in real time vs planning.
  - dan: "we feel like we're good with money. but we spent more than we made this month and we don't know what it was on"
    - paper cut expenses
    - prime as an enabler
- emily: when things aren't easy, we tend to over-maximize on planning. "we're getting groceries. let's get together with so-n-so and do this that and the other thing"
  - not present in everything because you're "maximizing" — hyper productivity
  - paying for it the next day in "recovery"
  - the emotional difficulty of intentionally not optimizing trips
- ma: applying emilies experiences to a person who lives close to a grocery store
- me: the practical that isn't part of his equation is "do a want to walk 16 miles to work? instead of working?"
  - ma: the theme is "are you questioning your assumptions"
- ma: credit cards as a strong counterproductively area.
  - trigger: in a moment when you think to yourself "nailed it" ask "but did you?"
- dan: "inboxers" group. the promise of "you'll never miss anything" and resulting anxiety.
  - me: consolidation
- me: the abolition of cleverness
  - we see this is code a lot. not
- me: seeing time. jane jacobs
- dan: seeing like a state
- ma: optimizations and interrogations
  - dan: is productivity the actual bottleneck?\
    - communication is the the bottleneck
  - me: over-indexing on personal productivity over corporate productivity (communication)
- ma: maybe the real friends productivity is the friends we made along the way
