## 2 The Fine Art of Correction
Why we Overestimate Setup

## Summary of the principle
> Preparation. Then presence.

I've felt this most in my evolution as a conversationalist — I can't say "podcaster".

My best conversations are when I prepare in advance.
But, in the moment, be perfectly present — not thinking about directing or framing — just being there.

### Thoughts with friends

* ma says that he thinks i'm good at this — actually changing my mind readily when better information is presented
	* he suggestions the notion that small changes can be harder than big changes — changing a destination vs correcting the path
* em mentions something she heard in a message "long obedience in the same direction"
	* there is no *moment of arrival*
* dustin admits the need to adjust feeling like a failure
	* identifies with the books line about "doing away with the stigma around constant correction"
* dan identifies with a tendency to overvalue upfront costs
	* uses a term a like "when your plans meet other people", in describing when and why plans often need correction
* i share about my excitement over learning this balance of "preparation and presence"
	* used epicreact.dev/podcast as as example of a success on this front — careful upfront planning followed by presence in every episode, willingness to review and correct, and adapt
* emily identifies the need for "emotional preparation to adapt"
* ma connects "rabbit holes", in the language of Shape Up
	* identifying things that will *probably* go wrong or take to long
* i share mine and nellie's "worked/didn't" framework
* dan inquiries about when the reversal of this principle. posits that "first impressions" are something that are difficult to course carrect
* i share that i visualize first impressions creating a moat around a castle. good first ones make that relationship easy to revisit. bad ones can require require heroing effort to overcome
* dan "and sometimes you storm that castle to find nothing in the treasury"
