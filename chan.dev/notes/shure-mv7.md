## First Comparison

This test was run to compare the natural sound of the Shure MV7 compared to the Shure SM7B.

Every mic has a different sweet spot.  
But as a first step, I set this mic up in the same position I set my SM7B in — pointed at the corner of my mouth, at a 45 degree angle, with the capsule about 4-5" away.

Here are the results:

#### MV7

#### My take

To my ear (using ATH-40x headphones) the MV7 is noisier than the SM7B.  
I'm using the same preamp for both.  
So I suspect this is electromagnetic interference noise.  
The SM7B is exceptionally.  
The MV7 doesn't seem to be.

The Mv7 sounds very "metallic" to me.  
There are a few words where you can hear a resonant, metallic, ringing — which is my least favorite sound in a mic.

It's not nearly as warm as the SM7B — one of the most desirable characteristics of that mic.  
This is understandable, given the smaller capsule.  
But either way, you're not getting that classic low response.
