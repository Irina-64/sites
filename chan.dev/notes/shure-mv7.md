## First Comparison

This test was run to compare the natural sound of the Shure MV7 compared to the Shure SM7B.

Every mic has a different sweet spot.  
But as a first step, I set this mic up in the same position I set my SM7B in — pointed at the corner of my mouth, at a 45 degree angle, with the capsule about 4-5" away.

Here are the results:

#### Compared to the SM7B?

To my ear (using ATH-40x headphones) the MV7 is noisier than the SM7B.  
I'm using the same preamp for both.  
So I suspect this is electromagnetic interference noise.  
The SM7B is exceptionally.  
The MV7 doesn't seem to be.

The Mv7 sounds very "metallic" to me.  
There are a few words where you can hear a resonant, metallic, ringing — which is my least favorite sound in a mic.

It's not nearly as warm as the SM7B — one of the most desirable characteristics of that mic.  
This is understandable, given the smaller capsule.  
But either way, you're not getting that classic low response.  



## Compared to the best sounding USB mic I've found

Last year I one a one page resource of my favorite hybrid (USB/XLR) Mic, the Samson Q2U:

http://shutupandstarttalking.com

I take the Q2U with me every time I'm away from my home studio and might need to record.  
It's sounds way better than it should for a pre-COVID price of $60.

Attached are samples of it compared to

#### Compared to the Samson Q2U

The Q2U makes the MV7 sounds thin and metallic — to my ears (using ATH-M40x headphones).  
So metallic, I could taste it under my tongue.  

The capsule is clearly no Unidyme III variant (SM7B, SM58, SM57) but it doesn't even sound like as balanced as a generic dynamic to me.

This is super disappointing.  

Now, for positives, the wind screen deed do better that the Q2U's included screen.

The MV7 is WAY better looking than the Samson Q2u.  
And It's getting harder and harder to find this mic for less than $100.  
Add to that the MV7's internal shock mount (decent, not great), cool stand adapter, and software which seems to eq the sound at capture time, and the new MV7 has a lot of potential for a practical difference of maybe $70.  

But, it's sad that a $250 mic from Shure doesn't sound as balanced — out of the box, to my ears, for podcasting — as a $60 mic from a 3rd rate electronics brand.
