For her 85th birthday, I interview my grandma — Carol "Gammy" Claypool.

My aunts threw a great party and asked if I'd provide the night's entertainment — an interview with the matriarch of our family tree.

I'm glad they did.

I've loved conversation my entire life.   
And from the moment I saw the [Talkboy in Home Alone 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ePrAxox-sq0) I've been obsessed with what comes out of people when the little red light is on.

Below are 80 minutes of history, memories, and wisdom from Gammy on her 85th birthday.
